## 📌 Background & Overview  

### 🎯 Objective  

Developed a **Power BI dashboard** using the Global Superstore dataset (Orders, People, Returns) to transform transactional data into **actionable business insights** for strategic decision-making.  

The project focuses on:  

- Evaluating overall **sales and profitability performance**  
- Identifying **high-potential markets for expansion**  
- Prioritizing **profitable and scalable product categories**  
- Supporting **ROI-driven decision-making**  

---

### 👤 Target Users  

- Data Analysts & Business Analysts  
- Sales & Marketing teams  
- Route-to-Market & Strategy teams  

---

### ❓ Key Business Questions  

- What is the current performance baseline?  
- Which markets show the strongest growth and ROI potential?  
- Which products should be prioritized for strategic investment?  

---

### 🎯 Project Outcome  

Revenue scaled steadily, but **margin expansion remained constrained**, indicating operational cost pressure.  

Several regions demonstrated **strong margin quality and growth momentum**, highlighting expansion opportunities.  

Technology led revenue performance, though **return-heavy SKUs impacted profitability**. High-margin categories outperformed, while weaker segments diluted overall results.  

This analysis supports alignment between **market expansion strategy, product portfolio optimization, and profitability improvement**.

### IV. Sales Agent 

<img width="1300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54549eaa-4abb-4fdb-8f17-786abc3dcd04" />

### 📌 Key Findings

#### 1. Revenue & Profit Distribution by Sales Agent
**Anna Andreadi (US-West / Multi-US)** generated the highest **Revenue (~$2.82M)** but operated at a moderate **Margin (~11%)**, reflecting a **high-volume, competitive pricing model**.  
**Chuck Magee (US-South)** showed similar **revenue-driven performance** with mid-range margins.  

In contrast, **Nicole Hansen (Canada)** achieved the highest **Margin (~26.6%)** despite a smaller revenue base, while **Shirley Daniels (North Asia)** maintained a strong **Margin (~19.5%)** with steady growth momentum.  

→ **US agents = Revenue engines** | **Canada & North Asia = Profit efficiency leaders**

#### 2. Revenue Growth by Category Across Sales Agents
All agents sustained strong **YoY Growth (~50%+)**.  

High-margin agents (**Nicole Hansen, Shirley Daniels**) align strongly with **Technology (Phones, Copiers)**.  
High-volume US agents maintain broader exposure, including **lower-margin Furniture**.  

→ **Product focus differentiates Profit Leaders from Revenue Leaders**

#### 3. Overall Sales Efficiency Gap
- **Total Revenue:** ~$12.64M  
- **Total Profit:** ~$1.47M  
- **Overall Margin:** ~11.61%  

Margin dispersion ranges from **single-digit levels (US territories)** to **~26% (Canada)**.  

→ **Growth is consistent, but pricing effectiveness and execution quality vary significantly**

#### 4. Regional Impact on Profitability
- **US Regions (West, East, Central, South)** → **High revenue concentration, moderate margin**  
- **Canada (Nicole Hansen)** → **Smaller scale, highest efficiency**  
- **North Asia (Shirley Daniels)** → **Balanced growth, strong margin stability**  

→ **Less price-sensitive regions demonstrate stronger margin sustainability**

#### 5. Product-Level Profit Drivers by Agent
- **Phones (~$1.71M Revenue)** and **Copiers (~$259K Profit)** dominate contribution  
- Technology-focused agents outperform in **Margin Performance**  
- **Furniture-heavy portfolios** dilute profitability impact  

→ **Technology concentration = Structural advantage for top profit agents**

## 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendation  

| Strategy | Insight | Recommendation |

| 🛒 **2. Product & Sales Portfolio Optimization** | - Technology is the **core profit driver (~14% margin)**. <br>- Phones & Copiers contribute the largest share of profit. <br>- Furniture drags overall margin (~7%). <br>- Sales agents focused on Technology achieve higher margins. | - Increase Technology mix within the sales portfolio. <br>- Upsell high-margin products (Phones, Copiers). <br>- Tighten control or rationalize low-margin Furniture lines. |
| 👥 **3. Sales Capability & Performance Gap** | - Revenue is partially concentrated among top performers (~$2.82M vs ~$0.9–1.6M). <br>- Significant margin gap across regions (11%–26%). | - Replicate best practices from high-margin agents across teams. <br>- Strengthen pricing and product-mix coaching in volume-driven regions. <br>- Shift KPIs from revenue-only to margin-based performance. |
